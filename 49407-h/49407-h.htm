of health plants his victorious banner on a giant bowlder,
that shall forever point the westward hoers to the fountain
of health. (<i>Sets down pail, and looks at his hands.</i>) A fountain
of water would be more to my taste just now: the handle
of that pail is in a bad condition, but I'll fix it. (<i>Takes a
newspaper from his pocket, and wraps it round handle while

over the continent, from Switcham, Vt., to the top of the
Sierra Nevadas. Such outward applications of the infallible

health re-animates the sinking frame. For further particulars

up a little, or some of these hardy miners will take it for a
bad spell: and, being so choice in their language, that would
never do. (<i>Works with brush. Sings</i>),&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Busted! I do believe he's trying to blast it

<p><span class="smcap">Silas</span> (<i>turning, and presenting brush like a pistol</i>).
Look out for paint. (<i><span class="smcap">Mother</span> steps back.</i>) I beg your pardon;
but, if there is any thing in my personal appearance
that leads you to suspect my jacket needs dusting, a gentler

my breath.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Served you right. Who are you? Where did
you come from? What's that daub?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas</span> (<i>aside</i>). Daub! shade of Michael Angelo! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
Madam, I am a missionary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Good gracious! A parson. Why didn't you
say so before? Settled?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> No. (<i>Rubs shoulders.</i>) I thought I was just
now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Where do you hail from, parson?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Switcham, Vt. That answers your second interrogatory.
The third I will save you the trouble of
repeating by announcing the fact that the daub, as you are
pleased to call my etching, is the good tidings I am ordained
to proclaim. That's one of my sermons; and sermons in

of brevity to recommend them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> "Busted's Balm." Are you Busted?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> No; but I shall be if you ask any more questions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Oh, come, be sociable! I came from Vermont
myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Possible?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Yes: twelve years ago, with my husband, expecting
to return in two years with a fortune; but in two
years husband died.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Ah! A <i>mis</i>fortune.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> And here I've been ever since, the mother of
this camp; and my boys&mdash;white, black, and yellow&mdash;take
good care that I have my share of the dust.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas</span> (<i>shrugs shoulders</i>). I understand&mdash;with a broom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> La, parson! don't bear malice: do you suppose
I'd have struck you, if I'd an idea of your cloth?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Thank you. My coat <i>is</i> rather thin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Expect to locate here? The boys would be
mighty glad to have you; and they'd see that you had a
peaceful hearing, if they had to shoot the whole congregation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Would they? Very kind of the boys, but I hope
they'd leave somebody to pass the contribution-box.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Vermont would see to the dust.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Who's Vermont?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> The best of the lot, steady as a clock, but a
powerful wrestler; that's his weakness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Is it? I've a strong weakness in that line too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> You'd have no show with him. Now, parson&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Oh, drop that! This person is no parson, but, if
the old saying is true, just the opposite; for I am a deacon's
son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> The deuce you are!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> No: the Deuce's grandson.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> What's your name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Silas Steele, jun. I'm the little one, and dad's the
big Steele. I'm travelling for Busted's Balm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Where do you expect to find it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> 'Tis found already. And, to spread abroad the
glorious fact, I've taken a large contract; and it's the biggest
undertaking any undertaker ever undertook. I never realized
before that there was such a strong objection to clean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
white paint; but I've found it out now, for I've been peppered
by indignant shot-guns, pounded by angry broomsticks,
booted by revengeful brogans, and bulldozed by man's faithful
friends, the puppies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Then, you're only a pill-pedler, after all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> A pill-pedler! great Busted!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> You said you were a missionary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> So I am. What nobler mission than mine, to
proclaim to a suffering world, sunk in misery by aches and
torments, the advent of the wonderful cure-all that will eradicate
the ills with which the body groans, from bald head to
bunions? For further particulars see small bills. (<i>Looks off <span class="fs70">R.</span></i>)
Ah! there's a bowlder I missed; must secure that before
Foggarty's Liniment, or some other quack nostrum, defaces

Good-by, widow. Give the parson's benediction to the

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Well, of all harum-scarum chaps, he's the

<div class="center">

(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Vermont</span>, <span class="fs70">R.&nbsp;2&nbsp;E.</span></i>)</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> Little one come, widder?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> No: supper's all ready for her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> Stage's about due. Widder, I've a little matter
on my mind I'd like to pan out afore the little one gets
here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> About her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont</span> (<i>sits on rock <span class="fs70">R.</span></i>). Yes, about her. It's ten
years, widder, since your old man passed in his checks, and
had a hole scooped for him out there under the hill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span> (<i>sighs</i>). Ah, yes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> It was jest about that time that I dropped
into your ranch one dark night, with a little girl in my arms.
She might have been a five-year old&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Or six: we never could make out. She was
burning with fever. You found her in a basket, floating in
the creek.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont</span>. Exactly. That's what I told you, and I
brought her to you because you was the only female woman
in the camp.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Yes: bless her! she brought luck with her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> You bet she did. Those little ones always
do. Well, I read a long while ago, while prospecting in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
big book,&mdash;that's pay-dirt way down to bed-rock,&mdash;about
that king pin what struck the little game "Faro," and named
it arter hisself, how he had a darter what found a baby floating
in a creek, and called it "Moses;" and, as I warnt goin'
back on scripter, I named our little one Moses too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> And, as that was not a girl's name, I changed
it to Moselle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> That was too Frenchy for the boys; so they
split the dif, and called her Mosey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> And Mosey is just worshipped by the boys. I
believe, if you would let them, they would cover her with
gold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont</span> (<i>rising</i>). Likely. But, when I washed that nugget
outer the creek, I staked a claim in which I wanted no
partners. Says I, "Vermont, here's a chance for you to use
your dust, and don't you forget it." I believe the angels
dropped one of their little sisters into the creek, to make an
ugly old sinner ashamed of his wickedness. (<i>Passes his arm
across his eyes.</i>) Widder, you've been a mother to her, and
a good one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> And you, the best of fathers. Every year
you've sent her off to school, and to-day she comes back
to us&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> With Tom Carew, our Tom, the handsomest
and squarest miner in the diggin's. I wouldn't trust the
bringin' of her home to any other of the boys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Except Dick: she's very fond of Dick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> Dandy Dick, as the boys call him. Oh, he's
well enough for a short acquaintance. He's only been here
six months, and there's something about him&mdash;Well, if
Mosey likes him, it's all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> You're a detective?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerden.</span> Yes. Shall I have your help in securing this
fugitive from justice?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<i>coldly</i>). We're not man-hunters. Many a poor fellow,
made criminal by passion or misfortune, has drifted
among us to be made better by a life of hardship and privation.
We ask no man's past history. If he be knave or
fool, he shows his hand, and he is lost. Miner law is swift
and sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> You've your answer, stranger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerden.</span> All right: I'll find my man without your help;
but, if you should change your minds, there's a thousand dollars
for the man who gives information.</p>

White, black, and yellow. The widow said she had an assortment
of colors, and here they are. Put up your shooting-irons,
gentlemen: I'm a friend of the widow's. I left my
card here an hour ago. (<i>Points to rock.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Any friend of the widow's is heartily welcome.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> From the east, stranger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas</span> (<i>sets paint-pail down near rock</i>). Switcham, Vt.
Name, Silas Steele. Occupation, painter and decorator.

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Whitewash yourself? You took a big contract.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> No: only a chance acquaintance. She came from

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> So did I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Did you? Then, you're the man I've been looking
for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont</span> (<i>starts</i>). Eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> My old man took it into his head about twelve
years ago to start west, minin'; and we've never seen him
from that day to this. Nice old fellow, the deacon, but
queer. Started off without so much as a good-by, Hannah,
and has been lost to his family, the church, and Switcham,
ever since. But we heard from him occasionally in the
shape of gold-dust to mother, but no word or clew to his
whereabouts. Mother's worried so, I've come out here to
look him up if he's alive. Any of you know Deacon Steele?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jube.</span> Deacon who? Golly! we's all out ob deacons: dey
fall from grace when dey git out here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> You're wasting time, youngster: the deacon's
dead and buried.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> You knew him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> No: but deacons die young here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Perhaps 'tis Nevada.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont</span> and <span class="smcap">Jube</span>. Nevada!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Who's Nevada?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> The mystery of the mines: you may meet him here
to-day, to-morrow in some gloomy gulch,&mdash;a ragged, crazy
miner, seeking, as he has sought for ten years, a lost mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> A lost mine?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<span class="fs70">C.</span>) This was his story as I have heard it from old
miners. He was known among them a dozen years ago, as
a quiet, reserved man, working by himself, wandering off
prospecting alone. At times they missed him. He had
been off for a week, when, one night, he came in staggering,
faint from the loss of blood, with a deep wound in his head,
and the wild air of a maniac. From his broken speech, they
gathered this: He had found indications of gold, had
opened a tunnel, and worked far in, all by himself, mind, following
some theory of his own, when suddenly, with his pick,
he loosened a stone above his head, which fell and crushed
him; not, however, until he had caught one glimpse of a
rich vein of gold. Poor fellow, he could never find his way
back, and none of his mates could help him. They would
have believed his story to be but the wild speech of his wandering
mind, had they not found in his tangled hair, mingled
with dirt and blood, flakes of gold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> Poor old chap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> With a gold-mine in his hair. Rich old beggar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Nevada is no beggar; though no cabin is shut
against him, no miner's friendly hand withheld. He will
neither eat nor sleep until he has earned both food and shelter.
For a willing mate in an ugly tunnel, with a steady grip
and a strong arm, give me Nevada.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada</span> (<i>outside</i>). Who calls Nevada? (<i>Dashes down
run, and stands <span class="fs70">C.</span>; music pianissimo.</i>) Nevada, the gold
king. My dominions are beneath the hills, stretching away
in veins broad and deep, so rich that I could overturn
empires; but I am shut out, the golden doors are closed
against me, and the key, the key, is lost. (<i>Puts his hand to
head, drops his head, and comes down slowly; music stops.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Ah! it's one of his off days. Nevada, old man,
don't you know me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada</span> (<i>slowly raises his head, looks wildly at <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, then
his face brightens</i>). Tom, Tom Carew. (<i>They shake hands
warmly.</i>) You want me. Many a day we have worked together.
(<i>Looks round.</i>) And here's Vermont.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont</span> (<i>grasping his hand</i>). Right here, pard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada.</span> Ah! old grizzly and&mdash;woolly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jube.</span> Dat's me to a har.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada.</span> And little pigtail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Win-Kye.</span> Piggee tail velly well, John; alle same you,
John?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada.</span> I'm hungry and tired, Tom: give me a pick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Not to-night, old friend: you shall go to my ranch,
and to-morrow&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada.</span> To-morrow. (<i>Looks about wildly. All draw
away from him. Music pianissimo.</i>) To-morrow I must go
back, back along the ravine, three miles, then climb the
bowlders, to where that fallen giant lies across the stream;
over it to the gorge a mile beyond, and then&mdash;and then
I'm lost&mdash;straight ahead to the right, to the left, again and
again, no trail, no trace; and yet 'tis there, ever before my
eyes, the wealth of a kingdom, the jewel of Nevada, lost to
me forever. (<i>Covers his face with his hands.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Ah! if we could only keep him from that lost mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> What a wreck! But he's not the first man crazed
by gold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada.</span> Far off, a mother and her child wait anxiously
for my coming,&mdash;wait for the gold I promised them. I left
the little one sleeping in her cradle. Oh! when shall I see
my little child again? (<i>Music stops.</i>)</p>

<div class="center">

(<i>Enter, from cabin, <span class="smcap">Mosey</span>, with a change.</i>)</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle</span> (<i>running to him</i>). Now, Nevada, here I am.
Have you, too, missed me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada</span> (<i>looking into her face anxiously</i>). I know that
voice and that face.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Of course you do. It's the same voice that
has sang you to sleep many and many a time, and it's the
same face you have kissed often. Why don't you now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada</span> (<i>takes her face between his hands, and kisses her
forehead</i>). It's little Moselle back from school.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> With a head full of knowledge, and a heart
bubbling over with fun.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> And when the two get working together, this
camp will be a howling wilderness, you bet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Come, Nevada, mother will be glad to see you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada.</span> No, child: I cannot go in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Then, I'll lead you. You shall find plenty to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
do,&mdash;bring water and wood for mother; and when you are
tired I will sing for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada.</span> Sing! I'll come, I'll come. I love to hear
you sing. (<i>Music pianissimo.</i>) She was singing to the child
the whole day long,&mdash;the little one sleeping in her cradle.
She smiled in her sleep when I stooped to kiss her, and
that smile is ever with me. I see it in the first faint, rosy
tints of the breaking day, and watch it deepen and broaden
into gold&mdash;(<i>fiercely</i>)&mdash;gold that mocks me, drives me mad.
(<i>Music stops.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Come, come, Nevada, you need rest and quiet.
(<i>Takes his hand, and leads him into cabin.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada.</span> Yes, little one, with you. (<i>Music until off.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> He's safe for to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Now, if some good Samaritan would take me in,
I'd esteem it a favor for which I will pay liberally. (<i>Takes
bag from his breast.</i>) Art is my mistress; but, when I get
hungry, I turn my eyes from her lovely face to the ground,
and dig like the rest of you. There's a little left in the bag.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> You can't pay here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> No, tender foot; but you shall bunk with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> With you, Vermont? He'll be the first stranger
that ever saw the inside of your ranch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jube.</span> Dat's so. Swachability ain't no 'count wid him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> Come on, stranger: it's jest about the time I
fry my bacon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> And it's just the time I eat mine,&mdash;when I can
get it. (<i>Exeunt <span class="smcap">Vermont</span> and <span class="smcap">Silas</span> <span class="fs70">R.&nbsp;2&nbsp;E.</span>, <span class="smcap">Silas</span> taking

<p><span class="smcap">Jube.</span> Golly! de idea ob dat ole Vermont takin' in a

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> He's not mean with Mosey.</p>

I jes' like to see him set about it. Come on, Win-Kye: see

<div class="center">

(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Dandy Dick</span> down run, knapsack on back.</i>)</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span> (<i>speaking as he comes down</i>). If there's any fun,

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Ah, Dick!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Tom (<i>they shake hands</i>), you brought the sunlight
with you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Yes, Dick: Mosey's safe and well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Tom, the old hole's petered out. (<i>Takes off knapsack,
and drops it near rock <span class="fs70">R.&nbsp;C.</span></i>) I've dug and panned for
a week, and not an ounce of dust.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> That's bad; but better luck next time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Luck! Not while you hold to such an unlucky
partner as I. Tom Carew, I never met a man I so much
admired as I do you. When I dropped into this camp, a
stranger, without a penny, you took me by the hand, let me
in to your claim, an equal partner,&mdash;the best paying claim
in the camp,&mdash;till I struck it; since then we haven't panned
enough to pay for bacon. It's my infernal luck. I wouldn't
care for myself, but to blast your prospects of a rich find&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Hold on, Dick. You complain of bad luck,&mdash;you
whom Moselle loves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> That's another matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Right. The pure ore of a loving heart is not to
be compared to the glittering lie we take to ourselves with
which to purchase happiness. The one purifies and ennobles
its possessor, the other too often drags us down to the dust
from which we filch it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Sentimental, Tom? Why, what's come over
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> A woman. No, an angel. Dick, the sweetest
woman you ever set eyes on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> That's Moselle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Oh, you're blind!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> And you expect me to see through your eyes?
Well, who is this paragon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Moselle's friend, who came home with her to-day.
I have only met her once. She is all grace and beauty, and,
I'll swear, as good as she is beautiful. If I could only win
her, Dick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Well, what's to prevent?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> I am only a poor miner, and she&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> A poor judge of manhood, if she takes you at
your own valuation. Send her to me: I'll tell her, that if
she wants a warm heart, a determined spirit, and a courageous
arm, she will find them in Tom Carew, who, in those virtues,
stands head and shoulders above all the miners of Nevada.
I suppose that is her picture you are nursing so carefully in
your belt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> No: that is a poor devil whom a detective is tracking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Ah! let's have a look at him. (<i>Takes picture.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> A detective was here an hour ago; but it's not one
of our boys. (<i>Turns away to <span class="fs70">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span> (<i>looks at picture, starts, but instantly recovers himself
as <span class="smcap">Tom</span> turns</i>). No: he's none of us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Not a bad face?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> No, but a weak one. A good subject for some
designing villain to make a victim of. (<i>Hands it back, <span class="smcap">Tom</span>
replaces it in belt.</i>)</p>

<div class="center">

(<i><span class="smcap">Moselle</span> runs on from cabin.</i>)</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Now for a run.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Right into my arms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle</span> (<i>runs into his arms</i>). Why, Dick, I never
thought of seeing you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> But you're glad to see me again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> O Dick! you know I'd rather meet you than
any other here (<i>sees <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, draws away from <span class="smcap">Dick</span>, and casts
down her eyes</i>), except Tom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Humbug!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> And Tom is lost to me. Poor Tom! He's
discovered a wonderful nugget. It's in our cabin now; and
Tom is so worried that he's been watching the door ever
since it was deposited there, for fear some one should steal
it. Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> I was only waiting till you should appear to keep
Dick company. Now I'm off. (<i>Goes to <span class="fs70">R.&nbsp;2&nbsp;E.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Don't be gone long, Tom, we shall be so
lonesome without you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Oh, have your little love-feast! I'll be back in
time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> In time for what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> To count the spoons. (<i>Exit <span class="fs70">R.&nbsp;2&nbsp;E.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Now, what does he mean by that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> I'm sure I don't know, unless he expects you and
I to&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle</span> (<i>holding up her finger threateningly</i>). Beware!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Exactly. <i>Beware</i> silver ware, spoons. (<i>Puts arm
about her waist.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle</span> (<i>slips away</i>). Oh, drop the spoons!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> But you dropped my arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> I like freedom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Then, why do you run away from me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> To catch my breath. Freedom is a virtue.
You make it a vice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Ah! but remember, I haven't seen you for three
months. Think of the lonely hours without you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Think of my lonely hours over those horrid
studies,&mdash;geography, history, arithmetic! One and one are
two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span> (<i>again slipping his arm about her waist</i>). No: one
and one <i>are one</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> You're wrong, Dick: one and one are still
one and (<i>slips away</i>) one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Moselle, I'm afraid you'll never be won.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Not by arithmetic. I hate figures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> I admire yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Do you, Dick? What! in these rags? Ah!
you should see me in regimentals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Regimentals?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Yes: silks and satins, kids and laces, as
Madam Ferule turns us out for inspection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> I should like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> I hate it. Give me a gown like this, that
shows the honorable tears of contact with briers and rocks;
a pair of boots like these, that won't slip on the bark of
trees,&mdash;and I'm just jolly. I can run, climb, fly. And here
I am wasting time. I can stand still no longer. I'm off
(<i>flies up run</i>): catch me if you can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Moselle!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle</span> (<i>stops and turns</i>). Well, Dick?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Good-by. In a few moments I shall have left the
camp.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle</span> (<i>coming down</i>). Left the camp! why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> That is my secret; you may hear bad report of
me, may be told to shun me, taught to despise me; but,
Moselle, believe me, I love you, and will one day ask you to
be my wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Your wife! Dick, who are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Still Dick, or Dandy Dick as the boys style me:
the other, an honored name, must still be withheld, even
from you. You see, I am frank with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Frank! you tell me nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Exactly; but I love you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> You needn't have told me: I knew it long
ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> And I may hope?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Yes, on one condition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Name it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle</span> (<i>darting up run</i>). That you catch me before I

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Dick, where's my knife? (<i>Looks round.</i>) Gone!
The cabin is upside down, no hatchet, no knife; nice housekeeper
to leave when one goes a journey. There's his pack,

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> I wonder what keeps Moselle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<i>rises, and removes his hat</i>). Miss Fairlee!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> O Mr. Carew! the very man I was thinking of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Were you? That's odd&mdash;no, even&mdash;for I was
thinking of you: in fact, I've done little else but think of you.
(<i>Confused, takes up pack.</i>) No: I don't mean that&mdash;confound
this strap!&mdash;you see, my partner has left every thing
in confusion: he's no housekeeper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> Did you ever know a man that was? You need
a wife, Mr. Carew.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> I know it: that's the reason I was thinking of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes</span> (<i>laughs</i>). You're the tenth miner who has said
the same thing to me within a month.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Only ten? well, it's been a pretty bad month.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> I hope not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Yes: the boys are off in their holes. Wait a few
days, and the air will be black with matrimonial speculators.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> Then, I think I'd better be leaving.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Good fellows, too, who will make their advances
timidly, and feel relieved when they are put out of their misery
by a refusal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> All of them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<i>dropping pack</i>). No: for here and there among
miners, as among men in every station, you will find one
who looks upon women as pure gold; as something to be
approached with reverence, and, if won, to be enshrined in

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> Such men are scarce.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> And such women plenty, but they don't come this
way often.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> Did ever such a woman cross your path?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<i>sighs</i>). In my dreams.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes</span> (<i>laughs</i>). A visionary woman. Do you see her
often?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> As often as I see you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes</span> (<i>turns away confused. Aside</i>). This must go no
farther. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Mr. Carew, would you do me a service?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Willingly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> A very dear friend, one to whom I am in duty
bound, has left his home and friends. I have reason to believe
he is in this part of the country. Will you help me
find him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<i>agitated</i>). Very dear to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes</span> (<i>casting down her eyes</i>). Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<i>after a struggle</i>). His name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> I cannot tell you that: I cannot even give you
the name by which he is known.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Then, how am I to discover him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> You have my name: go among the miners, tell
them of me and my quest. He will hear of me, and, in spite
of dangers that beset him, will find some way to meet me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> You set me a hard task.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> But you will make the attempt? O Mr. Carew!
if you could look into that once happy home, now desolate
by the absence of a son, for whom a fond mother is slowly
but surely breaking her heart, a loving sister mourning, and
I&mdash;I would give the world to reclaim! (<i>Weeps.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> He shall be found. I'll seek him. Your name
shall be the spell to conjure him from his hiding-place, were
he in the deepest mine of Nevada.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> Oh, thanks, thanks! I knew that in you I should
find a friend, a helper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<i>bitterly</i>). Rare confidence, when you have known
me but a day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> Longer than that. Your brave acts, the generous
promptings of your true and noble heart, have been morning
lessons to me for many a day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> You speak in riddles. Where have you heard
aught of me?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> From Moselle, who believes, were she in danger,
you would never forsake her. From her eloquent thankfulness
of heart, I was led to hope that I, too, might find a
champion in you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Thank you. You were right. I will serve you
faithfully.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes</span> (<i>giving him her hand</i>). Thank you. (<i>Looks into
his face, then casts down her eyes, and slowly exits into
cabin.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<i>stands looking after her, then looks at the hand she
took, then sighs</i>). "One who is very dear to me." She said
that,&mdash;said it calmly, never dreaming of the crushing force
with which those words fell. One very&mdash;He is her lover,
perhaps her husband. And I&mdash;I love her. (<i>Sighs.</i>) Well,
old boy, you've struck a blind lead this time. No pay-dirt
here; and yet, I'll swear there was something in those sweet
eyes of hers. (<i>Sighs.</i>) I must forget her. I'll quit the
camp, get far away, and then&mdash;no, I have promised to serve
her, and I'll do it. Bring him to her arms. (<i>Sighs.</i>) Not a
pleasant task; but I'll do it, I'll do it. (<i>Goes to pack.</i>) Now
for my knife. (<i>Opens pack, pulls out blanket.</i>) There's no
knife here. (<i>Unrolls blanket. Sitting on rock, photograph
drops out.</i>) What's this? A picture! (<i>Looks at it, rises.</i>)
It's Agnes, Agnes Fairlee; and he, Dick, is the runaway, her
lover, perhaps her husband, Fairlee? (<i>Pulls other picture
from belt.</i>) Why, this (<i>looks at it closely</i>) is Dick. Put a
beard on that face, and 'tis Dick the forger. I sha'n't have
to go far to find him; and he and I both love the same
woman. One word to that detective, he is in prison and she
is free. Well, I must be pretty far gone to harbor such a
thought. Betray my partner, the man with whom I have
eaten and slept, dug and quarried? No, no, not for so bright
a pair of eyes as yours, Agnes Fairlee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span> (<i>outside</i>). Moselle, where are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle</span> (<i>laughing</i>). Ha, ha, ha! Seek and find, seek
and find.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Ah! I had forgotten our Moselle. She loves him;
and he, villain that he is, has trifled with her. She must be
protected, saved, though justice overtake him. (<i>Darts up

<p><span class="smcap">Jerden.</span> How he sleeps! No wonder, poor devil!
These miners are any thing but sociable, when the officers
of the law are to be entertained. Every cabin shut against
us. Fortunately old Vermont took himself off to-night; and
I've taken possession, no doubt to be turned out on his
return. This beard's mighty uncomfortable. (<i>Takes off

he stood between me and the dearest wish of my life; but I
have him now. A rare streak of luck. I forged the check
he bungled with. Like a fool, he cut and run. That was
all right, for had he faced the music it might have been hot
for me; but she, Agnes Fairlee, she, too, disappeared. I had
risked all for nothing. But as Jerden, the detective, I have
tracked him, and found her. Now let me get him away
from here: she will follow, and then&mdash;(<i><span class="smcap">Dick</span> moves.</i>) Ah!

<div class="center">

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes</span> (<i>at door</i>). May I speak with your prisoner?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerden</span> (<i>bows</i>). I hate to refuse a lady; but my orders

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> In jail?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerden.</span> Still, as you seem to be a very dear friend of

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> You will grant my request?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> You will leave us alone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> I give you my pledge he shall not escape.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerden</span> (<i>goes up</i>). Then, I will retire&mdash;out of hearing,
but not out of sight. My eyes will still be upon him; and, if
he attempts flight, a well-aimed bullet shall be the signal for
my return. (<i>Exit past window off <span class="fs70">L.</span></i>)</p>

<div class="center">

(<i><span class="smcap">Agnes</span> looks after him, then comes down, and taps <span class="smcap">Dick</span> on

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> Richard!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span> (<i>starting up</i>). No, no, Moselle, 'tis false, false.
(<i>Rubs his eyes.</i>) Ah! Agnes, is it you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> Yes, Richard. How can you sleep at such a
time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> At such a time? It is the first real rest I have
had for a year. Agnes, if you had skulked and hid as I
have, if you had started from sleep at every sound, had
trembled at the approach of every stranger, had feared an
enemy would spring from every bush you passed, you would
know what a blessed relief it is to feel that all is over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes</span> (<i>sits on stool <span class="fs70">R.</span> of table</i>). Then, why did you fly
from justice?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Because I was a coward. Afraid to face that
same justice, and so have suffered more torments than even
her sternest sentence would have inflicted. Now I am
going back to face her, and proclaim my innocence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> Your innocence?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Have you ever doubted it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> Yes. Your strange flight, your silence for a
year, the circumstances&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Were all against me. Agnes, I am suffering for
the crime of another. You knew him,&mdash;Stephen Corliss.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> Your friend?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> So he called himself. You know how we became
acquainted. He was a friend of the junior partner of the
firm of Gordon, Green, &amp; Co., by whom I was employed.
He took a fancy to me, invited me to his rooms, insisted on
my being his companion in drives, to the theatres, and in
other amusements. It was at his request that I brought
him home, and introduced him to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> I never liked him: I told you his companionship
would do you no good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> You did. One day he asked me to step round to
the bank, and cash a check made in his favor by Gordon,
Green, &amp; Co. It was for twenty thousand dollars. I was
not surprised at the amount; as I knew he was considered a
man of wealth, and had large dealings with the concern. I
laughingly asked him if he was not afraid to trust me with
so large an amount, to which he replied, "No: if you are not
afraid to draw it." I went to the bank, agreeing to meet him
at his rooms with the money. On presenting it at the bank,
the teller looked at the check suspiciously, and took it to the
cashier. One of the clerks whispered to me, "Look out for
yourself, Dick, that check's a forgery." Forgery! I started
at the word: to me it had always been a horror. I left the
bank, not knowing what I was doing. I flew to Corliss's
rooms: the door was locked, and on it a placard, "Gone to
Europe." I turned and ran, that word "forgery" burning
into my brain, through the city, out into country, as if pursued
by tormenting fiends. A fever attacked me; and, when I
recovered, I found myself in the hands of strangers. Then
commenced my wanderings, which have ended here where
they should have begun,&mdash;in capture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> Have you never communicated with your employers,
avowed your innocence?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Never.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> Why, Richard, you have acted like a madman!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Haven't I? Perhaps the word "Fool" would be
better. How easily I might have cleared myself. How&mdash;Oh,
well! I'm not the first man who has been wrecked on
the reefs of "Might have been."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> But this man's motive? Why did he act thus?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Because he loved you. I was in the way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> Loved me? Then, through that love I can save
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Perhaps you can, but you shall not. I'll take my
chances with the law.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> I shall return with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> No: you must stay here in the charge of a friend,
the only man I can trust,&mdash;Tom Carew.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> He your friend? Why, he betrayed you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> So he did: I forgot that. But then, he put me
out of my misery, so we'll forgive him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> You may, but I, never. I had begun to like
your friend. (<i><span class="smcap">Tom</span> appears at window.</i>) I thought him
good and noble: I find him base and treacherous. I hate
this Tom Carew. (<i>Crosses to <span class="fs70">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<i>aside</i>). If you don't, you're not the woman I thought
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Oh! Tom's a good fellow, only just now he's in
love.</p>

<div class="center">

(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, door <span class="fs70">C.</span></i>)</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<i>to <span class="smcap">Agnes</span></i>). If he had no other excuse than that,
he would be what you just now styled him,&mdash;base and
treacherous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> Have you not proved yourself so, betrayed your
friend, deceived me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Deceived you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> Did you not promise to seek him I sought, to
bring him to me? How have you kept your word? By
betraying him to the man from whom I sought to save him.
Is this a token of your boasted regard for mothers, wives,
and sisters?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Hear me before you condemn. In these wild
lands is a tender flower, gladdening the hearts of rough
miners by its fragrance and beauty. From its coming it has
been fondly cherished and tenderly cared for. Yesterday it
was trampled in the dust by one who knew the fearful wrong
he was committing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Ah! The flower is Moselle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> And the despoiler you. That fact known among
the miners, your life would answer for it; but, knowing there
was one to whom you were very dear, for her sake I checked
the first promptings of vengeance, and gave you into the
hands of justice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> To save me from Judge Lynch. I see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Whose sentence you richly deserve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Don't be too sure of that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Now, having saved you from Judge Lynch, it is
your turn to save yourself from the detective. My horse is
tied outside. Take yourself off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> No, you must not attempt escape: his eyes are
upon you. A movement, and he will shoot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle</span> (<i>outside</i>). Ha, ha, ha! (<i>Runs in door, <span class="fs70">C.</span></i>)
Shoot! I guess not, when he's strapped to a tree. Hear
him holler.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerden</span> (<i>in the distance</i>). Help! Help!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Moselle, what does this mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Fun! I told you I was all ready for it; and
so, while Tom held the "catchee man," as Win calls him, I
gave him the benefit of a rope.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Hung him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Ha, ha, ha! No, only quartered him&mdash;under
a tree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Now, Dick, off with you. Here's my dust (<i>offers
bag</i>), and the horse will carry two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Not your dust, Tom. I'm to have a companion:
who is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<i>with a glance at Agnes</i>). Can you ask?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> I can. Moselle, will you go with me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<i>seizes <span class="smcap">Moselle</span> and places her behind him</i>). Do
you dare, before (<i>points to <span class="smcap">Agnes</span></i>) the one who has come
miles to reclaim you? You know where your duty lies.
Take her (<i>takes <span class="smcap">Agnes</span> by the hand, and leads her up to

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> What! Run off with my own sister?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<i>staggering back to window</i>). Sister?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> His sister! Ain't this jolly! O Dick!
(<i>Runs into his arms.</i>) I'm just dying for a run.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Then, off we go. (<i>Exit door <span class="fs70">C.</span>, with arm about

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes</span> (<i>aside</i>). He <i>is</i> a good fellow: only, as Dick says,

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> I wish I could say something to comfort her; but

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> How nobly he has acted, good fellow! Better
than that,&mdash;he's noble! (<i><span class="smcap">Tom</span> moves. She drops her head.
After a pause, both heads raised at the same time.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes</span> (<i>smiling</i>). Have you been dreaming, Mr. Carew?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> I wish I had.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> Dreaming of "the tender flower that gladdened
the hearts of the rough miners," or of "the visionary
woman"?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Whom I see when I look at you. And you hate

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> No! I admire you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<i>rising</i>). Miss Fairlee!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes</span> (<i>rising</i>). You have saved my brother from a horrible
death. You have offered him the means of escape.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> He will escape: my horse is swift.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> No! He is innocent of crime, so will not make
the attempt. He is probably now in the hands of the detective.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> But he went with Moselle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> Yes, to free the detective.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Well, I've blundered again. And you are his sister.
I never dreamed of that. Ah, if I had a sister!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> You would be very fond of her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Indeed I should.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> Well, as you have none, and you are Dick's partner,
why shouldn't you be fond of his sister?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Miss Fairlee! Agnes!&mdash;May I call you Agnes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> Dick does, and you are his partner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Agnes, I love you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> And I love&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<i>holding out his hands</i>). Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> To have you love me. (<i>Walks into his arms.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Lucky Tom. How much does it weigh?
(<i><span class="smcap">Agnes</span> and <span class="smcap">Tom</span> separate.</i>) What are you doing with my
teacher, Tom? Has she set you conjugating? I love&mdash;you
love&mdash;or do you both love? I guess if you'd had as
much of that as I had, you'd want a vacation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Well, we've been considering Dick's case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> And Dick's settled his case by giving himself
up to the detective, whom he mag-nan-i-mously&mdash;that's a big
word: hope I got it right&mdash;set free from the tree; and here
they are.</p>

the one with whom I am to settle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Yes: I'm the one (<i>presenting pistol</i>), and here's
the other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerden</span> (<i>retreating</i>). Take care: that might go off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> I'm afraid it will, if you don't. Hark you, stranger!
I gave Dick up under a mistake; and I'm afraid, that, when
the boys find it out, you'll have hard work to get away. So,
what's your figger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerden.</span> I don't understand you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> No? And you call yourself a detective. When
banks send out detectives, they want the rogue and the
money. When they can't have both, they'll take one. You
can't have Dick; so, what's the figger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerden.</span> Twenty thousand dollars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Twenty! Look here, stranger, ain't you settin' it
a leetle high? There's not so much money in the whole
camp.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerden</span> (<i>aside</i>). So I thought. He's mine. (<i>Aloud.</i>)
That's the sum. If you can't pay it, I take my man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Never.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Oh, yes, he will! I'm a little anxious to get East,
and he'll pay the travelling expenses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Well, you are a cool one; but you just wait until
I can wake up some of the boys. I shouldn't wonder&mdash;No,
no. Twenty&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes</span> (<i>to <span class="smcap">Tom</span></i>). Don't interfere, Tom: Dick's innocent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> All right, if you say so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> Moselle, we must go. Dick, will you walk with
me? I've something particular to say to you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> If Mr. Jerden makes no objection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerden.</span> All right. I'll follow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Of course. (<i>Gives arm to <span class="smcap">Agnes</span>, and goes to

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> Good-night, Tom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Good-night, Agnes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Agnes! Tom, you haven't&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Oh, yes, I have! Rich find. A nugget, Dick.
She's mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Yes, Dick: I caught them <i>mine</i>ing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerden</span> (<i>aside</i>). Ah! I have a rival here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Tom, old boy, it's glorious: you were made for
each other. (<i>Exit with <span class="smcap">Agnes</span>, door <span class="fs70">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Tom, hunt up daddy: he's lots of dust.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerden.</span> Miss Moselle, shall I attend you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> You?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> No: Moselle goes with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> No, Tom, you look out for daddy. Come,
Mr. Jerden, I'm your prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerden</span> (<i>offers arm</i>). Prisoner?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle</span> (<i>taking his arm</i>). Why not? One good turn
deserves another: you were mine a little while ago, now I
am yours: ha, ha, ha! how you did struggle to escape!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerden.</span> Ah! that was clever. Do you know, I would
like to present you with something for that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> With what, pray?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerden.</span> Something ladies are fond of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Oh, do tell me quick!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerden</span> (<i>showing handcuffs</i>). Bracelets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Mercy! come along. (<i>Exeunt <span class="fs70">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada.</span> I saw the narrow path my feet had made in
many journeys to it, I saw the tunnel I had dug into the
earth, the rocks I had blasted,&mdash;I can go straight to it.
And then I saw, Tom, I saw an open vein of running gold,
pouring out broad and deep. I dabbled my hands in it,
dashed it over my head, and then&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> O heavens! 'tis only his madness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada.</span> I woke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> To find it but a dream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada.</span> Yes, yes; but there's luck in dreams, and I

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Yes, Nevada.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada</span> (<i>goes and sits by fire rubbing his hands and

see faces in the fire,&mdash;her's and the little one. See the tall
flame back there; that's her face, but oh so haggard and pale!
She thinks I will never come; and see, there's a bright little
flame dancing up towards her, just as the little child used
to climb up into her lap; and there's the little one's face now,
and her little fingers beckoning to me. Yes, yes, I'll come,
I'll come, with the gold to make us all happy.</p>

<p class="noindent">In the classic vernacular of this benighted region, "you bet."
Oh for a bottle of Busted's Balm! I'm sore from crown
to heel. (<i>Drops pail near door <span class="fs70">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Well, stranger, I should say you'd been having a
rough and tumble with a grizzly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Wrong, stranger. Grizzly and I have been having
a "go as you please," and I'm several laps ahead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Where did you strike him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Strike him! Do you s'pose I'm such a fool as to
tackle a grizzly with his war-paint on? I struck for home: I
never had such a longing for the dearest spot on earth in all
my life. You see, stranger, I started out to do a little embalming
for the balm: your friend Vermont's hospitality and
bacon had made it necessary for me to take a little exercise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Well, I took a long constitutional, practising a little
here and there with the brush, until I espied away up a
bowlder,&mdash;such a bowlder for a six-sheet poster!&mdash;that
seemed to offer uncommon facilities for the display of the
pronunciamento.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> The what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Oh! that staggers you, does it? Well, that's high
jinks for the balm. It was the wildest spot I ever scrambled
through, the hardest climb I ever attempted; but I reached
it, spread the balm in gigantic letters, and was just putting
a stop to it, when the earth gave way, and down I went. I
didn't have time to take out my watch, but I should think it
was about an hour before I stopped dropping. When I did,
I found I was underground, evidently in a deserted mine. I
might have taken an observation; but an ugly growl in the
interior convinced me that the inhabitant of that sequestered
spot was not at home for company, so I came out. A little
too hurriedly for good manners, perhaps, but with a celerity
that astonished me, if it didn't the grizzly. (<i>Sits on bench.</i>)
Whew! such a run! Excuse me, stranger, if I stretch out
a bit. (<i>Lies on bench.</i>) I've had enough of the balm (<i>yawns</i>)
for one day, now I'm going in for a little of the balmy
(<i>yawns</i>) sleep. Stop a bit. (<i>Raises himself.</i>) Must look
out for the dust. (<i>Takes bag from his breast, and places it
under his head. Yawns.</i>) Such a tramp (<i>yawns</i>) along the
ravine, three miles. (<i><span class="smcap">Nevada</span>, who has been crouching looking
into the fire, raises his head, and looks at <span class="smcap">Silas</span>.</i>) Then
over the bowlders to where the big tree lies across (<i>yawns</i>)
across the creek. (<i><span class="smcap">Nevada</span> rises, and approaches stealthily.</i>)
Across it to the gorge, beyond (<i>yawns</i>), a good mile. (<i><span class="smcap">Nevada</span>

to the&mdash;(<i>Yawns and sleeps.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada.</span> He's found it! (<i>About to rush upon <span class="smcap">Silas</span>,
<span class="smcap">Tom</span> steps before him; they struggle, and <span class="smcap">Tom</span> forces him

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Madman, what would you do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada</span> (<i>in door</i>). Kill him. He has struck the trail.
He would rob me of my treasures, but I'll be before him.
Let him dare to meet me there; let him attempt to enter,
and he shall find old Nevada a giant defending his own.
His river of gold! ha, ha! The old man has not lost his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
cunning nor his strength. (<i>Shaking his fist at Silas.</i>) Beware

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Off again as wild as ever. (<i>Comes down, and

his throat. What could have moved him so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas</span> (<i>moves</i>). Along the ravine&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<i>starts back</i>). Ah! that old story. How often have
we heard it! Nevada's oft-told story in this stranger's mouth.
Has he in truth, as Nevada said, struck the trail that leads
to the lost mine? Has he found the clew to the mystery of
years? If he has, 'tis marked, and should be found. There's
a fortune for him who strikes it. A fortune would set Dick
free, and make Agnes my wife. So, Tom Carew, for love
and friendship try your luck, and&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas</span> (<i>moves and mutters</i>). Look out for paint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Right, stranger. Where you left your mark, I'll

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> O daddy, here you are! (<i>Crosses from <span class="fs70">L.</span> to

<p><span class="smcap">Jube.</span> Yas; but I got her all braced. I can finish in just

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> If you're not up there in less than three

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jube</span> (<i>runs up stage</i>). Don't you do it, don't you do it.
I was only goin' to say dat, dat somebody else down dar&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> Start.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jube.</span> Was Abigal's son. (<i>Dashes up run, and off</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Ha, ha, ha! Poor Jube! He missed his
chance by stopping too long "down dar." Now, daddy,
what's the matter? where's the "yearthquake" struck?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> That's some of the darkey's nonsense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Now, daddy, that's a fib. Look me in the
eye. No. Stop! If it's any thing I should know, you will
tell me: you've always been so good to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> Well, never mind me. What have they done
with Dandy Dick, the forger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> He's no forger. He's as innocent of crime
as you are. O daddy! I want some money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> All right, little one. (<i>Pulls out bag.</i>) What's
the figger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> It's rather high.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> Never mind: the bank's open.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Twenty thousand dollars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> Twenty! Bank's broke. (<i>Puts back bag.</i>)
We ain't struck no diamond mine lately, and nuggets are
scarce. Couldn't you make a little discount?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> O daddy! twenty thousand dollars will set
Dick free.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> Free! Not an ounce of dust comes out of
my bag for <i>him</i>. He's played you a mean trick; and, if the
detective don't take him off, I will. Why, Mosey, I thought
you had more spirit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> I love him, daddy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> And he with another gal hanging round his
neck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Why, daddy, she's his sister!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> What! (<i>Aside.</i>) Another prodigal! This
camp's getting lively. (<i>Aloud.</i>) His sister. That's another
sort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> And you will find the money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> Find twenty thousand? Oh, yes, Mosey! I'll
take my pick, and go right off. As finds <i>are</i> about here, it
may take a few years&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Years! We must have it to-day. O daddy,
you've plenty banked at Carson!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> Mosey, when you was a little gal, we used to
sit down by the creek.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Where you found me, longer ago than I can
remember.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> We used to sit there day after day, while I
told you stories.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Yes, fairy stories.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont</span> (<i>sits on rock, <span class="fs70">R.</span></i>). I'll tell you one now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle</span> (<i>sits on the ground beside him, throws arm
across his knee</i>). A fairy story?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> I reckon. Once on a time there was a gospel
shebang, and in it was a gospel sharp and a pan lifter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> You mean a church, a parson, and a deacon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> That's just what I mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Then, please remember, you are talking to a
young lady, and not to the boys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> Jes' so. Well, the parson and the deacon
didn't hitch horses,&mdash;couldn't work in the same hole,&mdash;were
always flinging dirt all over each other, whenever they
got to arguing. So one day they had it hot about wrastling
Jacob and the angel. The deacon thought Jacob didn't
have a fair show. He allowed that Jacob, at collar and
elbow, would have thrown the angel every round; and the
parson got mad, and told the deacon if he'd step behind the
she&mdash;church, he'd show him the angel's trip. The deacon
wa'n't to be stumped at wrastlin', so at it they went. Three
rounds, and the deacon went to grass every time. Now,
when a parson can throw a deacon, it shows a backslidin'
that's not healthy. So the deacon thought, and quietly
packed his kit, and started for green fields and pasters new,
leaving behind a wife and kids. Well, he struck jest about
such a place as this, and stuck to it twelve years. He didn't
forget the folks at home. Both his heart and his dust went
back to 'em, and sometimes he'd have given all his old
boots for one look at 'em.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Why didn't he go back?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> What! With that wrastlin' angel bossing
the shebang? Not for Jacob.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Ho, ho! You are the deacon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> I was. Now I'm only Vermont.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> And my daddy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> Last night I wrastled again. I was thrown,
and by a boy&mdash;my kid&mdash;from old Vermont.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Your son?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> You bet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Oh, daddy! ain't you glad?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> Glad! Why, Mosey, he's got the angel trip,
by which the parson threw me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> But ain't you glad he's found you? It must
be so good to hear news from home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> Well, Mosey, you keep quiet: I don't want
the boys to know he's my son. I've told you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> A fairy story. I understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> Jes' so. A fairy story, without the fairy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle</span> (<i>rising</i>). Oh! you're the fairy, for you are
always doing good. But where is he? I must see him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> In my ranch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> I'll just run down and have a peep at him,&mdash;the
boy who threw the deacon&mdash;no, the fairy. Ha, ha, ha!
(<i>Runs off <span class="fs70">R.&nbsp;2&nbsp;E.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> I reckon I'm a healthy old fairy.</p>

<div class="center">

(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Mother</span>, from cabin.</i>)</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Where's Moselle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> She's just run down to have a look at the
kid&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> A look at what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont</span> (<i>aside</i>). Hang it! There's a slip for the fairy.
(<i>Aloud.</i>) She's just run down to my ranch. She'll be back
in a minute. Widder, you believe that story about the creek
and Mosey?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> Don't believe it any longer: it's a blamed lie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Vermont!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> That's me, and here's the truth. I was diggin'
in Goblin Gulch in them days; and one night a woman,
with a child in her arms, came to my ranch. Poor thing!
she was all used up with tramping. She was looking for a
miner,&mdash;her husband, she said. She told me his name; and
when she found I didn't know him, she jest dropped on the
ground, and died there. I was alone with a dead woman
and a live child, and not another soul within five miles.
Well, widder, I was skeered. If I was found with them, as
likely as not I'd been lynched for murder. So I jest buried
the mother, and brought the child to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> What was the name of her husband?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> Widder, that's the mischief. Blame my old
wooden head, I couldn't remember. That's why I brought
Mosey to you with a lie. If I'd told the truth, that would
have been the first question you'd have asked me. If I
could only remember that,&mdash;if I could only hear it again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> That would be a clew to Moselle's parentage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> It will come to me some day. Till then, the
little one has a daddy in old Vermont.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> And a mother in me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont</span> (<i>holds out hand</i>). Widder, put it there. (<i>They
shake hands.</i>) I've heard tell of some wimmen that banked
all their affections in one buzzum, and, when the proprietor
of that bank went prospecting among the stars, kept gathering
the same kind of gold-dust for the final deposit. I
reckon, widder, you're one of that kind. And when you jine
your pardner, Tom Merton, pure ore will be scarce in
Nevada.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Ah, Vermont, what a pity you're a bachelor!
You'd make such a good father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont</span> (<i>confused</i>). Well, yes, jes' so. (<i>Aside.</i>) What
will she say when she sees the kid?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> And such a good husband! When I look at
you, it seems as if I had my dear old man back again. Poor
Tom! (<i>Puts apron to her eyes.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont</span> (<i>looks at her, scratches his head</i>). Poor old
gal! (<i>Puts arm around her waist.</i>) Cheer up, widder: it's
only a little while, and you'll hear his voice calling&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas</span> (<i>appearing on run</i>). Say, dad, where's my paint-pot?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> The kid! (<i>Runs off <span class="fs70">R.&nbsp;2&nbsp;E.</span> <span class="smcap">Mother</span>
screams, and runs into cabin.</i>)</p>

<div class="center">

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> For further particulars see small bills. After so
recent reminders of his connubial relations, it strikes me

<div class="center">

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> There was no one there. (<i>Sees <span class="smcap">Silas</span>.</i>) Hallo,
medicine man! Where's daddy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> My daddy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> No: mine,&mdash;Vermont.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas</span> (<i>aside</i>). Her daddy! Great heavings! The deacon's
a Mormon! (<i>Aloud.</i>) So, Vermont is your daddy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Why, certainly. Didn't you know that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Well, no. I haven't examined the family records
lately. Who's your mammy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Mother Merton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Murder!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> What's the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> That accounts for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Accounts for what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> The very affecting embrace of an aged Romeo
and a mature Juliet. I just now interrupted a tight squeeze,
in which your mammy was the squeezeed, and your daddy the
squeezor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> You saw that? Ha, ha, ha! Won't the boys
be tickled!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Boys! Do you mean to say there are boys too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Why, certainly, lots of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas</span> (<i>aside</i>). Great Scott! There'll be music in the
air, with an anvil chorus thrown in, when daddy goes marching
home. (<i>Aloud.</i>) But where do I come in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> You?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Yes. For if Vermont is your daddy, and Mother
Merton your mammy, and Deacon Steele is my father, and
Hannah Steele is my mother, I must belong somewhere
among the boys&mdash;of the old boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Why, you must be the kid&mdash;Abigal's son.
Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Abigal! (<i>Aside.</i>) What! Another family springing up!
Oh, this is too much! Hannah Steele's young
ones&mdash;Mother Merton's boys&mdash;Abigal's kid. The old
Turk! I must get the old man home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> So you're the boy that threw his father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Threw <i>him</i>! Why, he's floored <i>me</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> I'm real glad you've found him, he's so lonesome
sometimes. And daddy's got a big heart that would
take the whole world in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas</span> (<i>aside</i>). He seems to have taken in a pretty big
slice of the better half already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Now, you must have great influence with
daddy, and you must help me free Dick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Who's Dick?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> One of the boys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas</span> (<i>aside</i>). Thought so. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Well, how can I
help you free brother Dick?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> By inducing daddy to find the money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Oh! Dick's in a scrape?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Yes; and twenty thousand dollars will set
him free. Daddy has it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas</span> (<i>aside</i>). So daddy's a big bonanza, as well as a bigamist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> You see, Dick's accused of forgery; but he's
innocent. A detective has secured him, and will take him
back to-day, unless the money is found to reimburse the
bank with what Richard Fairlee is supposed to have defrauded
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Richard Fairlee? I've heard that name before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Alice Fairlee's brother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas</span> (<i>aside</i>). Heavings! Another tribe. Richard!&mdash;Ah!

<p><span class="smcap">Jerden.</span> Not with stolen gold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<i>comes down <span class="fs70">L.</span></i>). Stolen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerden.</span> Ay, stolen. You have jumped another man's
claim. For proof, you bring his pick left in the mine. Its
owner still lives.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Yes; and here he is (<i><span class="smcap">Nevada</span> comes down run
slowly</i>), the richest miner in all Nevada.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada</span> (<i>on platform</i>). That's me, boys, that's me; but
it's all locked up. Ah! if I could only find the key. You
should dig no more, boys. You should live in palaces, dine
off gold. Ah, gold, gold! Shall I&mdash;(<i>Sees gold on stage.</i>)
What's that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> That's fruit,&mdash;golden fruit, dug right out of your
garden, Nevada. Your mine is found.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada.</span> No, no: I've been up the ravine three miles&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> So have I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> Then climbed the bowlders&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> To where the giant lies across the stream&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada.</span> Over it to the gorge a mile beyond; then to
the right&mdash;to the left, and, and&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> There's where you missed it. Had you turned
back five rods, you would have found a clump of bushes
hiding the gorge below; and there lifting your eyes, you
would have seen on a bowlder high up, a sign&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Busted's Balm, you bet!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Right, stranger. You gave me the clew. Where
you fell, there is the old mine. Do you hear, Nevada? your

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada.</span> My mine, my&mdash;Now, Tom, don't trifle with
the old man. You could not have found what I all these
years have sought in vain. No, no.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Nevada, do you know this? (<i>Showing pick.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada</span> (<i>takes pick</i>). Why, Tom, Tom, this is mine,&mdash;my
old pick! Where did you find it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Where you left it. Old man, look at me. Did I
ever deceive you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada.</span> It <i>is</i> my old pick (<i>hugs it</i>), and that's my gold.
(<i>Comes down.</i>) Let me touch it. (<i><span class="smcap">Tom</span> takes up a nugget,

I slaved! Ah! you have embittered my life, rich as you are.
You might have blessed me had you come sooner; but now,
now (<i>throws down the gold</i>), O Tom, Tom! I'd give it all
for one sight of the wife and little one. (<i>Sobs, and falls on
<span class="smcap">Tom's</span> neck.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Ah, tears! that's good: he's all right. Take him
in, Mosey. (<i><span class="smcap">Moselle</span> leads <span class="smcap">Nevada</span> into cabin.</i>) Now,
you wait, Jerden, and you'll find the old man ready to treat
with you for Dick's freedom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerden.</span> I decline to treat with him or you. I shall take
my prisoner, Richard Fairlee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas</span> (<i>comes down</i>). What name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerden.</span> Richard Fairlee, forger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Ah, forger! I thought I knew something about
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerden.</span> Well, what do you know?</p>

proof that the forgery perpetrated a year ago was not
the act of their clerk, Richard Fairlee, but was a shrewd
plot concocted by one Stephen Corliss, for the ruin of that
young man."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> The truth at last!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes</span> (<i>takes his hand</i>). Good news, brother!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> That man!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerden.</span> Yes, that man. Agnes Fairlee, to win you I
have plotted. I have failed, and now await my sentence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> I told you miner law was swift and sure. (<i><span class="smcap">Jube</span>

before him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jube</span> (<i>wrests pistol from him</i>). Dis is a private way,
dangerous passing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerden.</span> Curse the luck! (<i>Turns, and runs off <span class="fs70">L.</span> behind

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> Not that way, man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> The ledge! the ledge!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jube.</span> Don't you do it. Ah! he's gone ober de ledge,
down three hundred feet. Good-by, detect! (<i>Comes down.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes.</span> What a horrible fate!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Better that than the tree.</p>

Tom has,&mdash;the name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Widow.</span> What name?</p>

(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Nevada</span> from cabin followed by <span class="smcap">Moselle</span>.</i>)</div>

arms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada.</span> My wife? where is she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont</span> (<i>takes off his hat</i>). In heaven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada</span> (<i>covers his face</i>). My poor wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> She couldn't find her husband, so she went
home to her father. But the child&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada.</span> Ah, the child! my little Lisa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont</span> (<i>aside</i>). Lisa! Now, there's a name; and I

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Lisa, Lisa! Why, somebody called me by
that name long, long ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada.</span> No: that was my child's name.</p>

your child that has been tenderly cared for, who is the luck
of this camp. (<i>Crosses, and takes <span class="smcap">Moselle's</span> hand.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Well, you see, I'm not used to the customs of
this part of the country; and I don't know how to break it
to mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> Break what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> This new departure of yours. By the way, how
many have you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> How many what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Well, it's rather a delicate question for a son to
ask his father; but how many wives have you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> Silas Steele, are you mad? One,&mdash;your
mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Oh! then the widow and Abigail and the boys

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> Well, what of them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Are they relatives of yours?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> I have but one relative in this part of the
country, and he seems to be little better than a fool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Mother says he takes after his dad. (<i>Aside.</i>) I
guess the old gent's all right, after all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> Look here, Silas. (<i>Leads him down <span class="fs70">C.</span></i>)
Where did you learn that trip by which you threw me last
night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Oh! from Parson Bunker. Remember the parson,
don't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont</span> (<i>aside</i>). I thought so,&mdash;the wrestling angel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Cold day for him when he gave that away, for I
threw him every time after that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont</span> (<i>excited</i>). What! you threw the parson?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silas.</span> Just as easy as I laid you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont</span> (<i>excitedly shakes his hand</i>). Silas, I'm proud
of you. Look here, widder, Nevada, Tom, everybody, this
is my son from Vermont. Look at him: he can throw the
parson, the wrestling angel. Look at him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Your son? then, you are married?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> Well, I hope so. I'm going home to see
Hannah, and make up with the parson, after I've had a shy
at his shins with the angel trip.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> And leave me, daddy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> Ah, little one, that will be hard! but Nevada
has jumped my claim with a prior claim. In you he's found
his child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada.</span> Yours and mine, Vermont. You must never
forget, that, when I deserted her for love of gold, you took
her to your heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> I couldn't help it. Blamed if the little thing
didn't crawl right in, and nestle, as if she belonged there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> And it was such a warm nest, I hope I shall
never be turned out of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont.</span> Never, you bet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada.</span> You shall go home well fixed. The old mine
shall be made to give up its treasures. Henceforth it shall
be known as the Carew and Murdock mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> No, no, Nevada: I have no right&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada</span> (<i>takes his hand</i>). We must be partners; for
what I lost, you found. In our good fortune all shall share.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span> (<i>takes <span class="smcap">Moselle's</span> hand</i>). Then, I'll take mine
here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada.</span> And rob me of the jewel I prize the most?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Not rob, father, only give it a new setting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> In my heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> You can trust him, Nevada; and he's had such
bad luck, he deserves a nugget.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> Thank you, Tom. One of these days I'll
speak a good word for you with his sister.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Do I need it, Agnes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agnes</span> (<i>gives her hand</i>). Not with me, Tom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jube</span> (<span class="fs70">R.</span>). Golly! see 'em parin' off. Nex' couple, slaminade.
Say, tender hoof, whar's your pardner?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont</span> (<i>points to gold</i>). Nevada, shall I gather up the
dust for you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada.</span> No: scatter it among the boys. It is dust,
indeed, no longer to be prized by me, but for the richer
treasure it has disclosed (<i>to <span class="smcap">Moselle</span></i>),&mdash;you, my darling.
(<i>Puts arm about <span class="smcap">Moselle</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moselle.</span> O father, the clouds are lifting! You are
coming out of the darkness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nevada.</span> Yes, little one; and in the new light of your
eyes, I see tokens of the wealth I abandoned for a phantom.
In you I find&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vermont</span> (<i>takes <span class="smcap">Nevada's</span> hand</i>). A nugget, you bet!</p>
